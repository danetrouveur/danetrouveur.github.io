        <title>The Mean Value Theorem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of all mathematics that I’ve studied, I would say the most interesting subject that I find is without a doubt, &lt;strong&gt;analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. I find my fancy quite inevitable: the history of analysis can be seen as the history of physics itself, from Newton’s description of all of motion through differential equations to Einstein’s formulations of gravity via differential geometry. Despite a person who understands only parts of it, I find the ideas irresistable to the say the least. I could shed tears just by thinking of the beauty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, rather than focusing on the physics, however, I would like to introduce you to another part about the field of analysis that I love: it’s &lt;strong&gt;thoroughness&lt;/strong&gt;. By looking into the fundamental tools that humanity has devised to tackle and triumph in proving the intuitive, one cannot but be amazed. Personally, I am quite the geometric guy; I like to visualise and “see” what I’m dealing with. In this sense, I would like to introduce you to one of my favourite tools that has undeniable power that prevails throughout calculus: the mean value theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a single curve, described by a functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) of a single parameter \(t\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/Cauchy&apos;s_Mean_Value_Theorem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cauchy&apos;s_Mean_Value_Theorem.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite easy to imagine how there would always be a point \(t\) on the curve whose gradient would be parallel to the line that connects the two endpoints. This is the basis of what we call Cauchy’s mean value theorem (or the generalised mean value theorem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$\frac{f&apos;(c)}{g&apos;(c)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(aforementioned, there exists a point whose infinitesial slope equals the slope of line that connects the two endpoints)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The useful of this equation comes from the fact that it easily relates functions with it’s derivatives, prevailent in analysis. One of its most astonishing uses, to me personally, is how its used to prove the seemingly unprovable &lt;strong&gt;Taylor’s theorem with the remainder&lt;/strong&gt;. In first year calculus, physics and math students alike, everybody sees the theorem takes it as some sort of impeccability, something that is so often used but is seemingly impossible to grasp one’s head around. However, we can provide a quite clear-cut proof using Cauchy’s mean value theorem from above, providing us freedom from the negligence we once dealt this theorem with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us first present the theorem with the remainer in all its glory. Taylor’s theorem with the remainder states that any function that is differentiable \(k+1\) times on \((a,x)\) with the \(k\)-th derivative continuous on \([a,x]\) can be expressed as a sum like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$f(x)=T_n(x)+R_n(x)$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$T_n(x)=\sum^n_k=0\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k\hspace{1cm}R_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(a)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof starts with stating that the two parameterised functions that are to be inputted to Cauchy’s mean value theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$F(t)=f(x)-\sum^n_{k=0}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(t-a)^k\hspace{1cm}G(t)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(a)}{(n+1)!}(t-a)^{n+1}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully choosing the two points to be evaluated between to be \(a=a\) and \(b=x\),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$\frac{F&apos;(c)}{G&apos;(c)}=\frac{-\sum^n_{k=0}\frac{f^{(k+1)}(a)}{k!}(c-a)^k-\sum^n_{k=0}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{(k-1)!}(c-t)^{k-1}}{(n+1)(c-a)^n}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:105%;&quot;&gt;
$$\frac{F(x)-F(a)}{G(x)-G(a)}=\frac{f(x)-\sum^n_{k=0}\frac{f^{k}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k}{(x-a)^{k+1}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where equating the two expressions result in the Taylor’s theorem with the remainder that we stated above.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Astrophotography</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos of the sky that I took in Yeoncheon-gun, Sintan-ri, Korea, April 2nd. I took them myself! The first pic has the Big Dipper in it ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_2996.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_2996.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A photo of the Big Dipper along with a commet over some fences and a tree. Personally, the whole composition really reminds me of Yun Dong-ju and his poems.  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/IMG_3012.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_3012.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A photo of Milky Way galaxy behind some mountains. The texture of the mountains is what I really love about this one; they look so oriental for some reason!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promising beginner of astrophotography I dare say!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Differential Forms, Equations, and Electromagnetism</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differential forms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;differential equations&lt;/strong&gt;, and their relationship are pivotal in the construction of the theory of &lt;strong&gt;electromagnetism&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently, I’ve been very intrigued by this exact thing, and tried tying everything together in the context of electrostatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These notes are on my recent strides in these subjects, also available on &lt;a href=&quot;/notes.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m particular proud of the second document, where I tightly related these topics in a way I thought was appropriate. Hope it helps anyone who comes across it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These notes were for learning the basics of &lt;strong&gt;differential forms&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object data=&quot;mypdf.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;embed src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jusqdIjoVnIS0_3TrR0w2SsJUkX6RTmN/preview?usp=drive_link&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download it &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/resources/Mathematics__Differential_Forms.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These notes were for the midterms of &lt;strong&gt;electromagnetism 1&lt;/strong&gt; (PHY2009-01)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object data=&quot;mypdf.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;embed src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgo-0bY71gVfCH4aZAid5NJIP8PCQX8m/preview?usp=drive_link&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download it &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/resources/Physics__Differential_Equations_in_Electromagnetism.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I record here a few note I’d like to make. Throughout the journey, I was able to realise the importance of the field of &lt;strong&gt;real analysis&lt;/strong&gt; with it providing a vigorous foundation for integration in higher dimensions and on manifolds. Albeit that I’ve understood only a small portion of the whole, I was also able to sense that I wanted to further investigate what it meant to integrate over singularities like those provided by point charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to mention that upon studying electrostatics, I was again suprised by the power of abstraction and generalisation. There was a huge chunk of detail in veil when electrostatics was explained by Griffiths’ book on Electrodyanamics. Frankly, I found the book, along with the book by Jackson, extremely chaotic and baffling in its way of explaining things (I’d go a whole day talking about it). I’m certain that I would’ve found the whole subject impossible to tackle if not for the separate studying. In this sense, I want to take this opportunity to emphasize to others and my future self the following: &lt;em&gt;when things seem incomprehensible, the fault is often on how, the way that you’re going about it, rather than how much you’re able to tackle the ideas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to my Website!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi friends and family! This is the first article in my website. I’m still working on the whole thing, so please don’t expect alot for the first few months. While the whole thing is working out, you should really check out my &lt;a href=&quot;/about.md&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page. It has a short description of who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also planning to write a lot of academic posts, for archiving and etcetera. My most recent interest lies in a topic called &lt;strong&gt;differential forms&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean, what’s life without a daily dose of new maths? So here’s a cool equation for y’all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;
$$\int_{M}d\omega=\int_{\partial M}\omega$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you know, it’s called the &lt;strong&gt;generalised Stokes’ theorem&lt;/strong&gt;. One of my favorites at the moment!&lt;/p&gt;
