title: The Absurdity of Quantum Theory
category: Academic Life
description: I am inherently a person who likes mathematics and physics all alike. To me, especially when one is talking about theory, I personally find them, not to a certain extent, but exactly the same thing. Consider the following: in manifold theory (a geometrical theory in its core) first layed out by Riemann, to motivate our use of point derivations as a basis for our tangent space, we construct an isomorphism between the vector space of point derivations and the vector space $$\boldsymbol{R}^n$$. This kind of construction is of course a thing of abstract algebra, which stems from the study of polynomials by Galois. As such, in mathematics, we weave ideas that are seemly irrelevant to explain and describe the previously incomprehesible.
