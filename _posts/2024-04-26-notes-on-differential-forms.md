Differential forms, equations and their relationships are pivotal in the construction of the theory of electromagnetism. These notes are on my recent strides in these subjects, tightly relating one to another in a way I thought was appropriate. Hope it helps anyone who comes across it! 

These notes were for learning the basics of **differential forms**!
