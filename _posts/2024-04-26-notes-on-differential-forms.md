**Differential forms**, **differential equations**, and their relationship are pivotal in the construction of the theory of **electromagnetism**. Recently, I've been very intrigued by this exact thing, and tried tying everything together in the context of electrostatics. 

These notes are on my recent strides in these subjects, also available on <a href="/notes.html">**notes**</a>. I'm particular proud of the second document, where I tightly related these topics in a way I thought was appropriate. Hope it helps anyone who comes across it!

These notes were for learning the basics of **differential forms**!

These notes were for the midterms of **electromagnetism 1** (PHY2009-01)!

I record here a few note I'd like to make. Throughout the journey, I was able to realise the importance of the field of **real analysis** with it providing a vigorous foundation for integration in higher dimensions and on manifolds. Albeit that I've understood only a small portion of the whole, I was also able to sense that I wanted to further investigate what it meant to integrate over singularities like those provided by point charges. I suspect that it has to do with **differential topology** and **De Rham cohomology** in particular. **Lie derivatives** also seemed to often pop-up everywhere, and I also see them worth further investigation.

I'd like to mention that upon studying electrostatics, I was again suprised by the power of abstraction and generalisation. There was a huge chunk of detail in veil when electrostatics was explained by Griffiths' book on Electrodyanamics. Frankly, I found the book, along with the book by Jackson, extremely chaotic and baffling in its way of explaining things (I'd go a whole day talking about it). I'm certain that I would've found the whole subject impossible to tackle if not for the separate studying. In this sense, I want to take this opportunity to emphasize to others and my future self the following: *when things seem incomprehensible, the fault is often on the place you are looking at more than anything else*.
