Hi friends and family! This is the first article in my website. I'm still working on the whole thing, so please don't expect alot for the first few months. While the whole thing is working out, you should really check out my **about** page. It has a short description of who I am.

I'm also planning to write a lot of academic posts, for archiving and etcetera. My most recent interest lies in a topic called **differential forms**. I mean, what's life without a daily dose of new maths? So here's a cool equation for y'all.

<!-- <p style="text-align:center;font-size:150%;">
$$\int_{M}d\omega=\int_{\partial M}\omega$$
</p> -->

Just so you know, it's called the **generalised Stokes' theorem**. One of my favorites at the moment!
