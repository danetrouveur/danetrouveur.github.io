Topology, according to Wikipedia, is the branch of mathematics concerned wth the properties of a geometric object that are perserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumping, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself. However, I personally take this definition as an insult towards what topology actually tries to say.
