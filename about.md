Hi! I'm an undergraduate student currently studying in **Korea** ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· with experience living in **Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and **Singapore** ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.  I'm interested in all sorts of things, especially problems and topics that are abstract and fundamental. I currently major in **mathematics** and **physics**, but im also intrigued by the ideas in computer science, philosophy, pyschology, and music. In my free time, I like to ruminate a lot on topics and write about them, and I also love to play **jazz** with my piano. Hopefully, I'll upload a few videos here on this website!

The <a href="/notes.html">**notes**</a> page has a few notes and reports that I've taken both for classes and for personal aspirations. 
I am a strong believer in science being a collaborative endeavor; this website can be seen as me standing behind my words. 
The documents in gray are ones I deem insignificant, whereas the documents in black are ones in my current scope of interest or ones that I think I've made a worthwhile contribution. I got the idea of uploading the notes from the open-source works of <a href="https://dec41.user.srcf.net/"><strong>Dexter Chua</strong></a>, <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~vbouchar/"><strong>Vincent Bouchard</strong></a>, and <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/"><strong>Terrence Tao</strong></a>. 
I highly reccomend taking a look at them.

*Thanks for visiting!*
