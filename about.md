Hi! I'm an undergraduate student currently studying in **Korea** ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· with experience living in **Canada** ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ and **Singapore** ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬.  I'm interested in all sorts of things, especially problems and topics that are abstract and fundamental. I currently major in **mathematics** and **physics**, but im also intrigued by the ideas in computer science, philosophy, pyschology, and music. In my free time, I like to ruminate a lot on topics and write about them, and I also love to play **jazz** with my piano. Hopefully, I'll upload a few videos here on this website!
