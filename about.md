Hi! I'm an undergraduate student currently studying in **Korea**. I'm interested in all sorts of things, especially problems and topics that are abstract and fundamental. I currently major in **mathematics** and **physics**, but im also intrigued by the ideas in **computer science**, **philosophy**, and **music**. In my free time, I like to ruminate on a lot of topics by writing about them, and I also love to play **jazz** with my piano. Hopefully, I'll upload a few videos here on this website!.
